# RELAY_CIRCUIT_SINGLE_CHANNEL(TRANSISTOR BASED)
This repository contains the schematic of a 5V relay driver circuit built using a BC547 NPN transistor. The circuit is designed to safely control an SPDT relay from a low-power control signal such as a microcontroller GPIO.

Circuit Overview
1)BC547 used as a low-side transistor switch
2)1N4007 flyback diode for relay coil protection
3)LED indicators for input status and relay activation
4)Current-limiting resistors for LEDs and base drive
5)3-pin relay output terminal for connecting external loads
